# TandemLoopTest
 contains 4 program files
 
 I have used java as a programming language.



 1. In the first program I solved the problem by simply using switch and case.

 2. I was quite familiar with the second problem and solved it simply by using 
 the concept of odd numbers and for loop.

 3. A small modification in the second program gives me the output of this third 
 program. All I have done is that I have added the if else condition in this program.

 4. The fourth one was quite challenging but I have nailed it at the end by iterating 
 over the two arrays using for loop.
